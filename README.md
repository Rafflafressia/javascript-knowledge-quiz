## Description

The goal of this project was to create an interactive quiz with JavaScript. 

We were to have the page dynamically change to present the user with several questions which they can answer. 

Incorrect answers would remove time off their remaining time. 

At the end the user can enter their initials that get submitted with the time they completed the quiz with. 

## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
